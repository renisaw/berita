# Berita

Just a simple tool to read the summary of the latest news (for now it's only from Indonesian sites) in your terminal.

I'm aware that there are RSS modules out there like [feedparser](https://pypi.org/project/feedparser/). But I don't use it, because I only want built-in ones, so all you need is only python itself installed, which is already available in most linux distros.
